My name is Rob Ward and this website is where I am attempting to document what projects I work on and things that interest me in general.<br/><br/>
I am a Software Engineer specialising in Linux Development with focus on embedded systems, Linux Kernel development, "distro" development, Security and Networking. I have also worked on application development within embedded systems and web development. I also have a habit of finding random pieces of code or areas of development and learning them just to see how they work.<br/><br/>
I currently reside in Yorkshire in the UK.<br/><br/>
I have several hobbies ranging from flying model helicopters(crashing them with style may be more accurate) to gaming and going to the cinema. I also have an extensive collection of DVDs, most are TV series which I generally prefer over movies, most are SciFi/Fantasy series and I have way too much information about random TV universes in my brain to be considered healthy.<br/><br/>
Most of the content of this site is contained within the log where I'm trying to document what I work on and when....<br/>
